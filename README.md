Code and data from this paper:
Royle, J.A. and Turner, H., 2022. Density estimation in terrestrial chelonian populations using spatial capture–recapture and search–encounter surveys. Journal of Herpetology, 56(3), pp.341-348.

There are two scripts:
Script 1 processes all of the .gpx files and buffers each track. A number of objects are produced and saved. These are used when Script 2 is run.  It would be easy to automate and improve this script which I aim to do.
Script 2 summarizes all of the search tracks and capture locations into the encounter data file (EDF) and trap deployment file (TDF) that SCR models require. Then some SCR models are fitted using the oSCR package. 


More here later.
